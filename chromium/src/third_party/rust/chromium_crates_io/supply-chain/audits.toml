Audit notes:

* I've checked for any discussion in Google-internal cl/546819168 (where audit
  of version 2.3.3 happened)
* `src/lib.rs` contains `#![cfg_attr(not(test), forbid(unsafe_code))]`
* There are 2 cases of `unsafe` in `src/external.rs` but they seem to be
  correct in a straightforward way - they just propagate the marker trait's
  impl (e.g. `impl bytemuck::Pod`) from the inner to the outer type
